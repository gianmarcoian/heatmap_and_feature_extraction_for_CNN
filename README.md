# heatmap_and_feature_extraction_for_CNN

In this repo, you will find a Python notebook that I used for a project. These are the project proposals:

## Goal
The primary aim of this project is to develop a computer vision algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The algorithm will identify and classify digits (0-9) from images, providing an automated solution for digit recognition tasks. The algorithm will likely be a CNN with layers including convolution, pooling, and dense layers.

- **Dataset:** MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.
- **Model Development:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the digits.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measurements of the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Visualization of the results with confusion matrices and sample predictions.
- **Heatmap and Feature Analysis:** Use of Grad-CAM to visualize which regions of an image are most influential in the model's predictions by generating a heatmap. This heatmap highlights the significant features that lead to the model's decision.
